# Interview-Questions-Practive
This repo will contain problems and solutions to them commonly asked in interviews

This will be my guide to get back into preparing for interview's. 

## About Me

I have been working as a java developer for over 3 years when I created this repo and I 
have learned from my experiences that real life experience do not compensate for the 
brush on basics we need to do before we head for interviews. 

I will start going through problems in the resources sequentially. I Will number the problems 
in order I solve them and also group them in different categories. For this Project I will be 
practicing interview questions by a youtuber [Byte By Byte](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSYAntBbdd2SLYUqPIxo0w/featured)

I highly recommend him for starters since he has strong explanation before diving in code.
