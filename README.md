# Interview-Questions-Practive
This repo will contain problems and solutions to them commonly asked in interviews

This will be my guide to get back into preparing for interview's. 

## About Me

I have been working as a java developer for over 3 years when I created this repo and I 
have learned from my experiences that real life experience do not compensate for the 
brush on basics we need to do before we head for interviews. 

I will start going through problems in the resources sequentially. I Will number the problems 
in order I solve them and also group them in different categories. For this Project I will be 
practicing interview questions by a youtuber [Byte By Byte](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSYAntBbdd2SLYUqPIxo0w/featured)

I highly recommend him for starters since he has strong explanation before diving in code. 

This comprises of the first 50 problems you see in here.Once you have had a good grip on it we can move to more complete 
set of problems. I highly recommend [iDeserve](https://www.ideserve.co.in/) . They have a fair bit of questions and 
things are split in various categories.

## Things I picked Up on way
* Size of char is 1 byte ~ 8 bits ~ (2^8)256 values
* Sorting a map based on its value
* How to implement a Queue in java.
* For a number to be odd its first bit will be 1 in binary form (i.e 9 ~ 001001)
* (X) & (X-1) == 0 if X is a power of 2 ( X = 2^n [1,2,4,8,16,32....]) 
* We can check size of queue/stack
* Inside a method any changes to input object persists but if we swap the parameter object that does not persist after method is returned 
* Loss in precision can happen due to static variables being of diff type
* We can insert data in linkedlist based on index . If we add multiple values at same index
it pushes the other items down the list in order it is inputted.(Check Graph problem)
