<b>Implemented ALL </b>
1) Create a reverse linked List and compare it with first one
2) Create a reverse linked List<br>
Find the middle of the linkedList ignore middle element if odd number of letters<br>
Compare the first half of both the original and reversed
3) Use stack to push first half of list and then pop the stack if it is empty by end
then it means list was palindrome
