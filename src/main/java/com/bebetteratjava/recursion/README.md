# Recursion

##Coin Change Problem
##### Familiarity Rating 4
##### Things to ask before diving into problem
* What if no combination of coins can make change

##### Acceptable approach
recursion - 2^n

Better Performance
recursion with mnemonization ( far more efficient) - 

##### Best Approach
Dynamic Programming


##Permutations
##### Familiarity Rating 5
##### Things to ask before diving into problem
* What is the input? Strings are way easier to implement that int

##### Acceptable approach
Recursion

##### Best Approach

##Fibonacci Number
##### Familiarity Rating 8
##### Things to ask before diving into problem
* what is size of input? cause if input is big enough int or long may not be big enough to store the answer

##### Acceptable approach
1) Recursion
2) Recursion with memoziation

##### Best Approach
approach 2.
