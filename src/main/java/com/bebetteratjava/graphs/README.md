# Graph Problem

##Shortest Path
##### Familiarity Rating 8
##### Things to ask before diving into problem
* Is the graph directed or undirected? this is mostly likely cyclic
* Is this an acyclic graph? we are implementing version which has cyclic graph
* What is type of data stored in node?
* What if there is no path between nodes?

##### Not Acceptable approach

##### Acceptable approach
Use BFS to traverse the graph.
slight twist can be asked to print path from a to b

##### Best Approach
